# National Parks Data Viz Challenge

My three data visualizations illustrate various aspects of RV camping in the National Parks throughout time. Since 1979, RV camping has been on a decline, but numbers are still in the millions. 

## RV vs. Tent Campers Over Time
This animated graph shows rv vs. tent camping popularity through from 1979 - 2023. Although more popular in 1979, RV camping has consistently been less favorable than tent camping. Overall, both RV and tent camping numbers have dropped, especially after the stark decreases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Most Popular RV Parks Over Time
Using data from the 5 most popular parks for RV camping, changes over time show a drop in RV camping activity in Yellowstone NP and Death Valley NP. Yosemite NP, Great Smokey Mountains NP, and Glacier NP maintained relative popularity, although all RV camping numbers fell, regardless of park. Interestingly, Yosemite NP RV camping numbers reached record numbers since 1990 in 2016.
